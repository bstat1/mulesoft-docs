# Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish best practices and naming conventions to be followed for the Connect For Health Colorado (C4HCO) MuleSoft modernization effort (aka migrating from Oracle Fusion Middleware (FMW) to MuleSoft Anypoint Platform).  Although this document is intended to be somewhat fluid, it is important that the standards established herewith are followed as closely as possible, with updates being required only for special or omitted circumstances.

# Naming Conventions
